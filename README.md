## What's contained in here?

### Py Pi Roulette
A simple python script that uses the digits of Pi to help you to determine values of variables for use within your game. For example, you can pass in "number of enemies," "number of lives," and "number of rounds," and it might tell you "3 lives, 1 enemies, 4 rounds" corresponding to the first three digits of Pi (i.e., 3, 1, 4 from 3.1415...)

Usage:

```
> import pypi-roulette

> roulette_one("lives")
3 lives

> roulette_all(["lives","enemies","rounds","bosses"])
3 enemies
1 rounds
4 bosses
1 lives
```
